## Introduction {#introduction}

Software engineering focuses on identifying real-world problems and leveraging tools, techniques, and methodologies to develop effective solutions. As **The Infinites**, our project aims to build a **Student Hub**—a centralized platform where UJ students can discover and engage with societies, day residences, sports teams, and university events efficiently.  

## Background {#background}

The University of Johannesburg (UJ), founded in 2005, fosters innovation, diversity, and student development. With over 50,000 students—including 3,000+ international students from 80 countries—UJ spans four campuses and offers a variety of extracurricular activities:  

- **Day Houses**: Student-led communities for social and academic engagement.
- **Societies & Clubs**: Groups centered on shared interests (technology, arts, sports).
- **Sports Teams**: Competitive and recreational teams requiring structured management.
- **UJ Events**: University-wide activities (networking sessions, guest lectures).
Despite these offerings, there is no unified platform for students to discover and join these communities, leading to low engagement and missed opportunities.  

## Current Systems & Challenges {#current-systems--challenges}

### Recruitment Methods  
- In-person outreach and referrals.
- Informal Day House challenges (e.g., loser invites others).
- Google Forms for membership data, manually transferred to spreadsheets.

### Membership & Event Management  
- Society events require manual proposals for UJ administrator approval.
- Attendance tracked manually via messaging apps.
- No structured budgeting or engagement analytics.

These disconnected, manual processes hinder both student discovery and community administration.

<div style="page-break-after:always; visibility:hidden">\pagebreak</div>

## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

UJ’s fragmented student engagement systems create two major issues:  
1. **Discovery Barrier**: Students struggle to find and join campus communities.
2. **Administrative Inefficiency**: Community admins face challenges in membership management, event coordination, and participation tracking.

Overall, these issues reduce student engagement and complicate administrative tasks.

## Solution{#solution-overview}

**UJ Student Hub**: A unified digital platform that streamlines student engagement.  

- **For Students**:  
  - Discover and join communities and events in one place.
  - Receive tailored news, announcements, and event alerts.

- **For Admins**:  
  - Manage community profiles, memberships, and events with integrated tools.
  - Submit and track budget requests and attendance analytics.

<div style="page-break-after:always; visibility:hidden">\pagebreak</div>

# Feasibility and Risk Study{#Feasibility-And-Risk-Study}

## System Feasibility{#System-Feasibility}
The Student Hub  will integrate student engagement, sports, societies, day houses  into a single platform. While UJ already has some existing systems that offer partial solutions, they are scattered across different platforms and lack interactivity. Below is a comparison with current UJ systems.

**UJ uLink Portal**

**what it offers**

1. Provides access to academic records, timetables, student information, and course content.

**Limitations Compared to Our System**

1. Does not support event discovery, community engagement, or sports team management.
2. Lacks RSVP functionality for event attendance confirmations.
3. does not engange with students except academically.
3. does not provide news updates.


**How Our System Improves on It**
1. Adds interactive student engagement features beyond academics.
2. Allows students to explore and join communities and explore different aspects of being a student.


## Technical feasibility{#Technical-Feasibility}

Every software product needs to be evaluated and assessed whether it is appropriate to build. This feasibility study is done to evaluate whether the system is economically, technically, operationally, and financially sound.
The student Hub Will require several hardware and software requirements, including Hosting solutions, Device compatibility, the compatible operating system(s), tools for building front end and back end, scalable database for handling growing traffic.

**Hardware requirements**

1. Devices to access the student hub.
    + Any compatible smart device to access the system with an internet connection including smartphones, tablets, computers and laptops

2. Hosting Solution
    + Hosting the student Hub via a physical server will be costly, especially for a Third-year project, since it will require building, configuration and maintenance.
    + Free Cloud based hosting solutions will be necessary. This must be able to handle a fair amount of traffic since the system will be used mainly by the university students only.

**Software requirements**

1. Compatible Operating systems
    + Smart device must be running either on windows, iOS or android
2. Front End Tools
    + The student hub is a simple student friendly system, so it won’t require any advanced tools for building the front end. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap will do the work for the front end for the web application.
    + The mobile application will utilize tools such as react native for building an easy cross platform mobile application
3. Backend Tools
    + Since the system will storing data such as user profiles, community profiles, memberships, news, events, a reliable, scalable database will be required.
    + The system must also handle user authentication, so authentication tools will be necessary.
    + The system must also handle membership payments, thereby a payment gateway will be required
    + The system must also be able to send event reminders, even without an internet connection, thereby a service worker provider tool will be necessary

## Economic Feasibility{#Economic-Feasibility}

The cost for developing the Student Hub will be minimal since the project will be developed using free, open-source software and tools. Running, updating, and maintaining the system will not cost any amount since these are primarily voluntary efforts by the group members. hosting and storage could have its costs which could range between R0 – R400 depending on which domain the system will be using. Since this is a Third year project, direct revenue generation is not the primary focus, the benefits offered by the project are academic success, improvement in software engineering skills and knowledge and improved personal portfolios. Overall, the system will cost between the ranges of R0 to R400, thereby, this project is economically feasible due to minimal costs.

## Operational Feasibility{#Operational-Feasibility}

The aim of building the Student hub to address the needs of the problem and improve overall student engagement,sencondly, it is  to adress address the lack of awareness and access of information and lastly it is to adress the inefficient membership management for communities. By building the student hub, as the infinites, we aim to provide a platform for students to discover and connect with communities and increase student engagement and participation in campus life.
We would also be streamlining interactions between the community admins and the Student Development Practitioner as well as interactions between members and community admins.

- Test Results: Records of test execution and outcomes. 
- Defect Reports: Logs of identified defects, their status, and resolution details.

#### Defect Management

- **Reporting**: Any issue must be logged in our GitHub Issues tracker with a clear title, description, and reproduction steps.  
- **Severity Levels**:  
  - **High**: Blocks core functionality-must be fixed before the next demo.  
  - **Medium**: Affects major features but has a workaround-fix in the current sprint.  
  - **Low**: Minor bugs or UI glitches-address if time allows.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Team member assigns the issue to themselves.  
  2. Fix the bug and add a short test or screenshot.  
  3. Mark the issue "Ready for Review"  
  4. Another team member verifies the fix and closes the issue.
